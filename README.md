# esg-analytics

Based on Antoine Amend (Databricks) [ESG Scoring notebook](https://databricks.com/notebooks/esg_notebooks/02_esg_scoring.html), this repository contains the similar ETL pipeline as well as graph analytics script on Neo4j. 

This Scala code will work for Databricks 8.0+ and uses vanilla Spark, without any extra libraries.
